## Sending a question to GPT and receiving it in recorded form in English and Hebrew

This software allows communication with GPT using an api key so that you can talk to the computer (recording) send the question to the bot and it answers the answer to the question in the recording

It's also written in Python so it can be used in Python by calling the speak function (recording, which is disabled because it's sending to the client)
So if you use Python with the client the only actions the server does is send to the PGT

In addition, he translates the request into Hebrew (can be easily translated into any other language)
The server uses the Python API framework

The customer receives the recording data sent to him, displays it on the screen, and then using a dedicated button he sends the answer, and receives it in English and Hebrew and also answers in the English recording
